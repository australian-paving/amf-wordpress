# AMF WordPress

Share a WordPress media library between blogs.


## About

AMF WordPress uses the [Asset Manager Framework](https://github.com/humanmade/asset-manager-framework) to set an external WordPress media library for your WordPress installation. This allows you to insert images anywhere they're used in WordPress, including Gutenberg, featured images, and the Customiser all from the same media library.

*Note:* Currently, whatever default blog is set will *replace* the local media library of any blog that activates the plugin. This is a limitation of AMF that we're working on fixing.


## Installation

Download this plugin and [Asset Manager Framework](https://github.com/humanmade/asset-manager-framework), and activate both.


## Settings

By default the plugin will use the current site's media library. This should be changed from **Settings > Media** by setting the full domain of the WordPress blog you'd like to use. This could be an external WordPress site or another site in a MultiSite installation.
